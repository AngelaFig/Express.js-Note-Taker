# <Express.js-Note-Taker>

## Description

This Note Taker application allows users to write, save and delete notes in one location, thus allowing the user to organize and keep track of the tasks that they must complete.  In order to create this application I used front end starter code and added back end functionality with Express.js which allows the appliction to save and retrieve data from a JSON file.  When a user opens this application they will have the option to press a 'get started' button which then takes them to the Notes pages.  On the notes page, they will notice two empty fields on the right side of the page where the user can add a title and a note. Once that section contains information, the user will notice a save button appear which they can then click to save their note and have it displayed on the left-hand column. The user can then return to any of these notes by clicking on them, or the user can delete them once the task is complete by clicking the trash can button.
